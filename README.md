# Requirements

Before you begin, ensure that your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **Java:** The project requires Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 or later. You can download the latest version of the JDK [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use [OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

- **Gradle (Optional):** While the project includes the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`), you may choose to install Gradle globally. If you prefer to install Gradle, you can download it from the [official Gradle website](https://gradle.org/install/).

Make sure to set up your Java environment and Gradle (if chosen) before proceeding with the project setup.

# Run the Application

Use the Gradle Wrapper script to build and run the project:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

Alternatively, if you have Gradle installed globally:

```bash
gradle bootRun
```

This command will download the necessary dependencies, build the project, and start the Spring Boot application.
